                    In this test, you will see about twenty words, each for a short amount of time. Try to memorize as many as you can. Write down as many words as you remember. Order and case don't matter. Separate words by space or newlines.

                        Short-term memory (or "primary" or "active memory") is the capacity for
                        holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an
                        active, readily available state for a short period of time. For example,
                        short-term memory can be used to remember a phone number that has just been
                        recited. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal or active
                        maintenance is prevented) is believed to be in the order of seconds.
